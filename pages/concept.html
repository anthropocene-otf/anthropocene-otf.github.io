    <h1>The concept</h1>
    <p class="padding-bottom">The core of this project is to develop a parametric font modified, in its nature, by the concept that inspired us to create it in the first place: the impact of <b>humansâ€™ carbon footprint</b> on the environment.<br>
        This font dynamically changes its look following the AQI value of your nearest control station.
    </p>
    <h3>What is an AQI?</h3>
    <p>AQI stands for Air Quality Index and it is used in daily reports of air quality by all active control stations dislocated around the world.<br>
        The AQI is an average of various pollutants residing in the atmosphere; on higher values, it represents serious concerns and health hazards to human biological functions.
    </p>
    <p class="padding-bottom">We are currently using the <a href="https://aqicn.org/">aqicn.org</a> data</p>
    <h3>How does this font reflects the AQI in your area?</h3>
    <p>
        The AQI value range span is 0-300 (you can learn more about it <a href="https://aqicn.org/scale/">here</a>), and this typeface is a visual, straightforward representation of it.<br> 
        The lower the AQI value, the <b>bolder</b> the typeface becomes; conversely, it will get <b>thinner</b> and thinner the more the AQI value grows.
